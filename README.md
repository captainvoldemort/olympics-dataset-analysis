# **Olympics Dataset Analytics Project**

This project analyzes the Olympics dataset, focusing on various aspects such as athlete demographics, participation trends, and more. The dataset used in this analysis is available on Kaggle, and the Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code is provided here.

## **Introduction**

The Olympics dataset used in this analysis contains information about athletes, their events, and medals won. The project aims to explore and gain insights from this dataset through data cleaning, visualization, and analysis.

## **Notebook Usage**

To run this analysis and explore the findings, follow these steps:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file named **`OlympicsDatasetPBL.ipynb`**.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using **`pip`** if needed:
    
    ```python
    
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn
    
    ```
    
3. Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to perform data loading, data cleaning, and analysis.
4. Read through the comments and outputs in the notebook to understand the analysis process.

## Features

Important features of the project:

- **Demographics**: The dataset contains information about athletes' age, height, weight, and sex. We've handled missing values in these columns and observed trends in athletes' physical attributes.
- **Participation**: We've analyzed the participation of male and female athletes in both summer and winter Olympics over the years. The gender ratio varies between summer and winter Olympics.
- **Medals**: The dataset includes information about medals won by athletes. We've examined the distribution of medals across countries and athletes.
- **Predictive Modeling**: We've explored predictive modeling to suggest sports based on an athlete's height and weight. Two different models (K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Tree Classifier) were used for prediction.
- **BMI Analysis**: We've calculated and analyzed the Body Mass Index (BMI) of athletes and visualized trends in mean BMI over the years and across different sports.
- **Data Visualization**: The project includes various data visualizations, such as scatter plots, histograms, and correlation matrices, to help interpret the dataset.

## **Dataset Attribution**

The original dataset used for this analysis is available on Kaggle and can be accessed **[here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results)**. We acknowledge and appreciate the data source.
